# 💛 JavaScript Learning Journey

Welcome to my JavaScript repository! This repository documents my progress as I learn JavaScript from scratch, following structured video tutorials and building small projects along the way.

**Current Status:** 🌱 Learning & Coding Daily

---

## 📚 Course Material

I am currently following this YouTube Playlist to structure my learning:
> **📺 Playlist:** [JavaScript Tutorial Playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLwY6MfTsApmx3hJPoqFkmuWIv_3QTCkDG)

## 📂 Repository Structure

The code is organized into folders or files corresponding to the topics covered in the course videos:

| Directory/File | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| `01-Basics/` | Variables, Data Types, and Operators |
| `02-Control-Flow/` | If-else statements, Switch, and Loops |
| `03-Functions/` | Arrow functions, Callbacks, and Scope |
| `04-Arrays-Objects/` | Array methods (map, filter, reduce) and Object manipulation |
| `05-DOM/` | DOM Manipulation and Events |
| `06-Async/` | Promises, Async/Await, and Fetch API |
| `Projects/` | Small practice projects (Calculators, To-Do Lists, etc.) |

## 🚀 Learning Progress

Here is a checklist of the concepts I am mastering through the playlist:

- [ ] **Introduction & Setup** (Environment setup)
- [ ] **Variables & Constants** (`var`, `let`, `const`)
- [ ] **Data Types** (Primitive vs Reference types)
- [ ] **Operators** (Arithmetic, Logical, Comparison)
- [ ] **Control Flow** (Conditionals, Loops, Switch)
- [ ] **Functions** (Declarations, Expressions, Arrow Functions)
- [ ] **Arrays & Strings** (Methods and Properties)
- [ ] **Objects & Prototypes** (OOP basics)
- [ ] **The DOM** (Selecting and changing HTML elements)
- [ ] **Event Listeners** (Click, Hover, Input events)
- [ ] **ES6+ Features** (Destructuring, Spread, Modules)
- [ ] **Asynchronous JS** (Promises, Async/Await)
